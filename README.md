# Automated_Plant_Watering

This repo represents the work of Thishone Wijayakumar, Jin Taek Lee and Ajo Cherian Thomas in completing their Capstone Project for ESD 2018.  The goal of the project was to create a hardware and software product that would automatically detect when the soil around a plant was dry and then use an Arduino to automatically control a relay which would turn on a small water pump.
